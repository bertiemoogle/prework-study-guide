        <h2>HTML</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>The head element contains information about the web page.</li>
          <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user.</li>
          <li>Meta tags go in the head section of the HTML document, and contain data dictating aspects of the document's appearance.</li>
          <li>The first item on an HTML document is the DOCTYPE tag, letting the browser know it is dealing with an HTML document.</li>
          <li>Also in the head section goes the link to the CSS file (stylesheet), which sets the style for fonts, colours, font sizes etc.</li>

        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
          <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li>
          <li>Colours can be assigned in several ways in the CSS file, including the use of standard colour names or hexadecimal codes.</li>
          <li>There are three ways to style a webpage using CSS: inline CSS, internal CSS style sheet, and external CSS style sheet.</li>
          <li>An external stylesheet is the preferred method because it allows developers to keep all their CSS rules in a separate file, which makes design changes easier.</li>

        <h2>Git</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>git status: checks what branch we are currently on.</li>
          <li>git checkout -b branch-name: creates a new branch and switches to it.</li>
          <li>Github repositories enable you to store code files so that you can share your work and collaborate with others.</li>
          <li>README files can be added to repositories - these should be the first port of call for anyone wishing to examine your work.</li>
          <li>GitHub offers a task management tool called GitHub issues, which gives developers and teams an easy way to keep track of key tasks and progress.</li>

        <h2>Javascript</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>A variable is a named container that allows us to store data in our code.</li>
          <li>Control flow is the order in which a computer executes code in a script.</li>
          <li>JavaScript contains many features common to other programming languages, such as variables, strings, and data types.</li>
          <li>One way to declare a variable in JavaScript is to use the term "var", e.g. "var x = 52".</li>
          <li>To see JavaScript output in Chrome Developer Tools we use the Console. The JS command "console.log" is similar to commands such as "print" or "echo" in other programming languages.</li>
